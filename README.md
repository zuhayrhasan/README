## Hi there! 👋
My name is Zuhayr Hasan, and I'm a recent graduate Software Engineer from the University of Western Ontario. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 🧐 About Me
I'm passionate about software development and programming. During my time at the University of Western Ontario, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of software projects, ranging from web applications to mobile apps. In my free time, I enjoy mixing my two passions: football and programming, focusing on the analytical side of the sport.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
I'm currently working on a project called 'OddsOn', a website that provides live football match predictions using JavaScript, HTML, React, and the 'API-Football' API. With OddsOn, you can select one of the 5 main leagues and view every available fixture. Each fixture shows both team and individual statistics, formation, and other relevant information.

The project is still under development, but I'm excited to see where it goes. Stay tuned for updates!
